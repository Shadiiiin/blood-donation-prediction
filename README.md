# 🩸 Blood Donation Prediction (AutoML)

### Project Overview
A machine learning project to predict whether a donor will return to a blood center. This helps healthcare providers manage supply and target their outreach more effectively.

### Key Features
* **RFM Analysis:** Uses Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics to understand donor behavior.
* **AutoML with TPOT:** Used Genetic Programming to automatically discover the most efficient machine learning pipeline.
* **Data Cleaning:** Implemented Log Normalization on skewed monetary data to improve model performance.

### Results
* **Metric:** ROC-AUC Score
* **Score:** [Insert your score here, e.g., 0.78]

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt.`
3. Run the notebook `blood_donation.ipynb`.
